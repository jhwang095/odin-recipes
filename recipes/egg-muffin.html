                <h4>Step 1</h4>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.</li>

                <h4>Step 3</h4>
                    <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl. Stir in onion, green pepper, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Mix in sausage and Cheddar cheese. Spoon into the prepared muffin cups.</li>
                <h4>Step 4</h4>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
